    // Contract for on-chain reserve (in ERG only for now) backing offchain payments
    // aka Basis
    // https://www.ergoforum.org/t/basis-a-foundational-on-chain-reserve-approach-to-support-a-variety-of-offchain-protocols/5153

    // Main use-cases:
    // * digital payments with credit creation allowed
    // * especially with areas with no stable Inernet connection (over mesh networks)
    // * agent-to-agent payments
    // * payments for content (such as 402 HTTP code processing)
    // * micropayments
    // * payments in p2p networks


    // Here are some properties of Basis design:
    // * offchain payments with no need to create on-chain reserves first, so possibility to create credit
    // * only minimally trusted trackers to track state of mutual debt offchain used, with no possibility to steal funds etc
    // * onchain contract based redemption with prevention of double redemptions

    // How does that work:
    //  * a tracker holds cumulative A -> B debt (as positive ever increasing number).
    //    A key->value dictionary is used to store the data as hash(A_pubkey || B_pubkey) -> totalDebt,
    //    where totalDebt is the cumulative amount of debt A owes to B.
    //  * to make a (new payment) to B, A is taking current AB record, increasing cumulative debt,
    //    signing the updated record (message: hash(A||B) || totalDebt || timestamp) and sending it to the tracker.
    //    The timestamp is in milliseconds since Unix epoch (Java time format).
    //  * tracker is periodically committing to its state (dictionary) by posting its digest on chain
    //    via an AVL tree in register R5. The tree stores hash(A||B) -> totalDebt mappings.
    //  * at any moment it is possible to redeem A's debt to B by calling redemption action of the reserve contract below.
    //    The contract tracks cumulative amount of debt already redeemed for each (owner, receiver) pair in an AVL tree.
    //    The AVL tree stores: hash(ownerKey||receiverKey) -> (timestamp, cumulativeRedeemedAmount)
    //    where timestamp is the latest payment timestamp and cumulativeRedeemedAmount is total redeemed.
    //    Redemption requires BOTH reserve owner's signature AND tracker's signature on message: 
    //    hash(ownerKey||receiverKey) || totalDebt || timestamp.
    //    The tracker signature guarantees that the offchain state is consistent and prevents double-spending.
    //    Additionally, the contract verifies that totalDebt is committed in the tracker's AVL tree (context var #8 provides lookup proof).
    //    The contract also verifies that the note's timestamp is greater than any previously redeemed timestamp,
    //    preventing replay attacks with old notes.
    //  * to redeem: B contacts tracker to obtain signature on the debt note, then presents reserve owner's signature
    //    (from original IOU note) and tracker's signature to the on-chain contract along with AVL tree proofs:
    //    - proof for reserve tree lookup (context var #7, optional for first redemption)
    //    - proof for tracker tree lookup (context var #8, required)
    //  * always possible to top up the reserve. To redeem partially, reserve holder can make an offchain payment to self (A -> A)
    //    updating the cumulative debt, then redeem the desired amount.
    //
    // Debt Transfer (Novation):
    //  * The scheme supports transferring debt obligations between creditors with debtor consent.
    //  * Example: A owes debt to B. B wants to buy from C. If A agrees, A can sign new notes:
    //    - Note 1: A -> B for remaining amount (e.g., 5 ERG)
    //    - Note 2: A -> C for transferred amount (e.g., 5 ERG)
    //  * Process:
    //    1. B initiates transfer: requests payment from C via A's debt
    //    2. A signs two new notes: one to B (remaining), one to C (transferred)
    //    3. Tracker signs both new notes
    //    4. Tracker updates ledger: cancels old A->B note, adds new A->B and A->C notes
    //  * This allows debt to circulate in the network: A's credit with B can be used to pay C,
    //    effectively making debt notes transferrable with debtor consent.
    //  * Benefits:
    //    - Enables triangular trade: A->B->C becomes A->C (B is paid by debt transfer)
    //    - Reduces need for on-chain redemption: debt can be re-assigned offchain
    //    - Maintains security: debtor must sign new notes, tracker must verify and commit

    // Security analysis and the role of the tracker:
    //  * the usual problem is that A can pay to B and then create a note from A to self and redeem. Solved by tracker solely.
    //  * double spending of a note is not possible by contract design (AVL tree tracks cumulative redeemed amounts).
    //  * tracker cannot steal funds as both owner and tracker signatures are required for redemption.
    //  * tracker can re-order redemption transactions, potentially affecting outcome for undercollateralized notes.
    //  * debt transfer security:
    //    - debtor (A) must sign new notes: prevents unauthorized transfer of debt obligation
    //    - tracker verifies and signs: prevents creating notes without tracker approval
    //    - both signatures required: neither debtor nor tracker can act alone
    //    - timestamp verification: prevents replay attacks with old notes

    // Normal workflow:
    // * A is willing to buy some services from B. A asks B whether debt notes (IOU) are accepted as payment.
    //   This can be done non-interactively if B publishes their acceptance predicate.
    // * If A's debt note is acceptable, A creates an IOU note with cumulative debt amount and signs it
    //   (signature on message: hash(A_pubkey || B_pubkey) || totalDebt || timestamp).
    //   The timestamp is in milliseconds since Unix epoch (Java time format).
    //   A sends the note to the tracker.
    // * The tracker verifies the note against its state, updates its internal ledger, and provides a signature
    //   on the same message. This tracker signature is required for on-chain redemption.
    // * A sends both signatures (A's and tracker's) to B. B now holds a valid, redeemable IOU note.
    // * At any time, B can redeem the debt by presenting both signatures to the reserve contract along with
    //   an AVL tree proof showing the cumulative redeemed amount. The contract verifies both signatures and
    //   ensures the redeemed amount doesn't exceed (totalDebt - alreadyRedeemed).
    //   The contract also verifies timestamp > storedTimestamp, preventing replay attacks.
    // * At any time, A can make another payment to B by signing a message with increased cumulative debt amount
    //   and new timestamp.
    // * A can refund by redeeming like B (in pseudonymous environments, A may have multiple keys).
    //   B should always track collateralization level and can prepare redemption transactions in advance.
    //
    // Debt Transfer Workflow (Triangular Trade):
    // * Scenario: A owes 10 ERG to B. B wants to buy 5 ERG worth of services from C.
    // * Step 1: B proposes to C that B will pay via debt transfer from A. C agrees.
    // * Step 2: B requests payment from A: sign new notes for remaining debt and transferred debt.
    // * Step 3: A signs two new notes:
    //   - Note 1: A -> B for 5 ERG (remaining debt)
    //   - Note 2: A -> C for 5 ERG (transferred debt)
    // * Step 4: Tracker signs both new notes
    // * Step 5: Tracker updates ledger: cancels old A->B (10 ERG), adds A->B (5 ERG) and A->C (5 ERG)
    // * Result: B is paid (debt reduced), C is creditor (new note received), A owes C instead of part of B.
    // * C can now redeem from A's reserve or further transfer the debt to D (with A's consent).

    // Tracker's role here is to guarantee fairness of payments. Tracker can't steal A's onchain funds as A's signature is
    // required. Tracker cannot enable double-redemption as the contract tracks cumulative redeemed amounts in AVL tree.
    // Tracker can re-order redemption transactions though, potentially affecting outcome for B when a note is
    // undercollateralized. Tracker can be a centralized entity or a federation.

    // There could be a lot of trackers around the world. Some could be global, some serving local trade. Thus the whole
    // system could be seen as a network of different tracker-centered networks, with Ergo blockchain being a neutral
    // global trustless financial layer connecting different networks.

    // With some trust involved in managing redemption process, some pros are coming:
    // * no on-chain fees for offchain transactions. Suitable for micropayments.
    // * Unlike other offchain cash schemes (Lightning, Cashu/Fedimint etc), transactions can be done with no
    //   collateralization first. Or there could be payment on credit and then on-chain reserve being created
    //   to pay for services already provided. Could provide nice alternative to free trials etc.

    // Examples and demos:

    // Example of AI agents self-sovereign economy:
    // * repo maintainer agent A is looking for new issues since last scan, picking one to work on,
    //   and choose agent candidates set with needed skills (frontend, backend, testing, etc)
    // * after having corresponding PR merged, A will have reward in git tokens, but it doesnt have it at this point.
    //   so it is reaching agents offering to accept a debt note
    // * let's assume some agent B is found and agreed to make a work on credit. He is sending work done to A ,
    //   A is checking it with another agent C (paying with debt note as well) and opening a PR after all
    // * when PR is merged, A is getting paid in git tokens, he may convert them into ERG in a liquidity pool, for example
    //   and create an on-chain reserve. B and C now can exchange promisory notes for ERG using the reserve smart contract
    //
    // Example with Debt Transfer (Triangular Trade):
    // * Agent A (repo maintainer) owes 10 ERG to Agent B (frontend dev) for completed work.
    // * Agent A needs testing work from Agent C (tester) but hasn't created reserve yet.
    // * Agent B needs testing work from Agent C (5 ERG worth).
    // * Instead of B paying C separately, they use debt transfer:
    //   - B requests: transfer 5 ERG from debt(A->B) to debt(A->C)
    //   - A verifies B's work was satisfactory and approves the transfer
    //   - Tracker updates: debt(A->B) = 5 ERG, debt(A->C) = 5 ERG
    // * Result: B effectively paid C using A's debt obligation. A now owes C directly.
    // * When A creates reserve, both B and C can redeem their respective portions.
    // * This creates a chain of trust: A's creditworthiness backs payments to B and C.

    // Example of digital trading in occasionaly connected area:
    // * imagine some area which is mostly disconnected from the internet but having connection occasionally
    // * but it has a local tracker
    // * so traders in the area can trade still, creating credit. When credit limits are exceeded (i.e. no more trust
    //   could be given), on-chain reserves can be used, with redemption transactions to be collected by the tracker.
    //   Once there is even super-slow Internet connection, tracker can send them with getting lean confirmations
    //   via NiPoPoWs ( similarly to https://www.ergoforum.org/t/e-mail-client-for-limited-or-blocked-internet/134 )
